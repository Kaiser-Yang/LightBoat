## Useful Shortcuts

### Pairs Related

- [N] `ys{motion}{pair}`: Surround with `{pair}`.
- [N] `yss{pair}`: Surround the whole line with `{pair}`.
- [N] `yS{pair}`: Surround till end of line with `{pair}`.
- [N] `ds{pair}`: Delete surrounding `{pair}`.
- [N] `cs{old_pair}{new_pair}`: Change surrounding from `{old_pair}` to `{new_pair}`.
- [V] `S{pair}`: Surround the selected text with `{pair}`.

**NOTE**: There is a special pair called `f` (function call) provided by `nvim-surround`.
With this pair, you can add, delete, and change function call. For example, `ysiwf` will
let you input a function name, and then it will surround the current word with
`function_name(current_word)`. You can use `dsf` to delete the function call,
and `csf{new_function_name}` to change the function name.

**NOTE**: There is a special pair called `q` (quotation mark) provided by `nvim-surround`.
'', "", and \`\` are all valid pairs. With this pair, you can use `dsq`,
and `csq{pair}` to delete, and change surrounding quotation marks.

**NOTE**: For pair surround, all the opening brackets will add a space around the content,
while all the closing brackets will not add a space around the content. For example,
`ysiw(` will result in `( content )`, while `ysiw)` will result in `(content)`.

## Customization

### Key Mappings

There are two types of mappings in `LightBoat`:

1. The builtin key mappings, which are defined in the
   [keymap.lua](lua/lightboat/config/keymap/init.lua)
   file. These key mappings do not depend on other plugins.
2. The key mappings for plugins, which are defined in the plugins' files.

For the second type of key mappings, it can be divided into two sub-types:

1. Those can be customized by configuring `vim.g.lightboat_opts`.
2. Those can not be customized by configuring `vim.g.lightboat_opts`.

#### Customize Type 1 Key Mappings

Those below are the default configuration for some key mappings of type 1:

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- ...
    ['<leader>l'] = { key = '<leader>l', desc = 'Split right' },
    ['<leader>j'] = { key = '<leader>j', desc = 'Split below' },
    ['<leader>h'] = { key = '<leader>h', desc = 'Split right' },
    ['<leader>k'] = { key = '<leader>k', desc = 'Split above' },
    -- ...
  },
}
```

If you want to customize some key mappings. For example, you man want to use `<c-s>` to split
the window, you just need to update the `key` fields of the origin key mappings:

```lua
-- Make sure the variable is not `nil`
vim.g.lightboat_opts = {}
vim.g.lightboat_opts.keymap = {}
vim.g.lightboat_opts.keymap.keys = {
  -- Use `<c-s>` to split vertically
  ['<leader>l'] = { key = '<c-s>' },
  -- Disable the `<leader>h` key mapping
  ['<leader>h'] = false,
}
```

When you customize the key mappings, you should be careful that your new key is not
occupied by `LightBoat`. To do so, you can use `:map <c-s>` to check if the key is occupied.
In this case, you will get output like:

```
s  <C-S>       *@<Lua 1326: ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/blink.cmp/lua/blink/cmp/keymap/apply.lua:41>
                 blink.cmp
n  <C-S>       * <Lua 358: ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/lazy.nvim/lua/lazy/core/handler/keys.lua:121>
                 Flash Search Two Characters
x  <C-S>       * <Lua 163: ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/lazy.nvim/lua/lazy/core/handler/keys.lua:121>
                 Flash Search Two Characters
s  <C-S>       * <Lua 22: vim/_defaults.lua:0>
                 vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()
```

These are telling you that the `<c-s>` in `n`, `x`, and `s` modes are occupied.

#### Customize Type 2-1 Mappings

Let's take a look at the default key mappings of `comment`:

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- ...
    ['<m-/>'] = {
      key = '<m-/>',
      mode = { 'n', 'x', 'i' },
      expr = true,
      remap = true,
      desc = 'Toggle comment for current line',
    },
    ['<m-?>'] = {
      key = '<m-?>',
      mode = { 'n', 'x', 'i' },
      expr = true,
      remap = true,
      desc = 'Comment toggle current block',
    },
  },
}
```

To customize these above, you just need to update the `key` fields.
For example, if you want to update `<m-/>` into `<c-/>`, you can do this below:

```lua
vim.g.lightboat_opts = {}
vim.g.lightboat_opts.comment = {}
vim.g.lightboat_opts.comment.keys = {
  -- NOTE:
  -- `<c-/>` is a little bit special in nvim.
  -- To know what `<c-/>` really is in your terminal,
  -- you can press `<c-v><c-/>` in insert mode, which will give you the right key to binding
  ['<m-/>'] = { key = '' },
}
```

To know what is the current configuration, you can run
`:lua vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, 0, false, vim.split(vim.inspect(vim.g.lightboat_opts), '\n'))`
in an empty buffer, this will set current buffer with the current configuration.
